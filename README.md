# Road Accidents Reporting System

This is a Java console application that records and displays road accident data for cars and motorbikes in three major South African cities. The program utilizes a 2D array to store accident data and generates a comprehensive report, showing the total number of road accidents and identifying the city with the highest number of accidents.

## Features

- **Input Accident Data**: The program prompts the user to enter car and motorbike accident numbers for three cities: Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Port Elizabeth.
- **Display Accident Report**: A detailed report is generated that lists car and motorbike accidents for each city.
- **Total Accidents**: The application calculates and displays the total number of road accidents for each city.
- **City with Most Accidents**: The report highlights the city with the highest number of total accidents.

## Sample Output
